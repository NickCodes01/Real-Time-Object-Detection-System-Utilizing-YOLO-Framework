# Real-Time-Object-Detection-System-Utilizing-YOLO-Framework
Engineered a sophisticated real-time object detection system leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture within OpenCV, adept at recognizing and categorizing multiple objects in live video streams. Implemented performance optimizations, including adaptive input resolutions and dynamic confidence thresholds, to enhance processing efficiency and accuracy, thereby facilitating uninterrupted integration in complex, dynamic environments while providing instant feedback through detailed object classification.
